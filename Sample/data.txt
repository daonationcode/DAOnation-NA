Empowering communities is central to this objective, encouraging ownership through education, capacity building, and community engagement. By providing resources, fostering partnerships, and facilitating participatory decision-making processes, communities can tailor solutions that best reflect their needs and preferences.
Equity and accessibility are paramount in the pursuit of community food security in Texas. Recognizing the impact of factors like income, race, geography, and disability, efforts are made to address disparities and barriers to access. Prioritizing equity ensures that all Texans have the opportunity to access nutritious food, fostering health, sustainability, and resilience across the state.
